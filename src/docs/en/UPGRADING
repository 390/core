1. Server Consideration
=======================
Zikula can be upgraded to this version from any of the following versions: 1.2.x
or greater. If your installation is less than that, please upgrade to one of these
versions before proceeding with these instructions.

Before you begin your upgrade, there are some requirements and guidelines you
should consider to make upgrading, installing, running, and securing Zikula easier.
Please read the Zikula software condsiderations document.

- If you are using PHP 5.3.0 or greater please make sure the php.ini file has
  date.timezone set to a valid timezone like UTC, GMT+5, Europe/Berlin.

- The PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) library used with your PHP
  installation must support Unicode properties. For most installations this
  should not be an issue. The PHP command:

      echo preg_match('/^\p{L}+$/u', 'TheseAreLetters');

  should return the value 1 or true without generating an error. If not, then
  the PCRE library used by your PHP installation must be replaced with one
  compiled with the '--enable-unicode-properties' option.

2. Upgrading
============
Please follow the steps below in order, and read each in detail before proceeding.
Providing the instructions are followed exactly, the upgrade should proceed with
no problems.

  2.1 Backup your database and files
  2.2 Prepare your existing installation
  2.3 Run the upgrade
  2.4 Clean up and additional configuration
  2.1 Backup your database and files

  It is vital to backup your database and file system before proceeding with the
  upgrade. Upgrades cannot be rolled back, therefore the only solution is to
  restore from backup if problems occur. To backup your database, try using a
  tool such as mysqldumper, phpMyAdmin or alternately use SSH or your hosting
  control panel. Full instructions and tutorials on database backups can be found
  by searching the web and the documentation of your tool set.
 
  2.2 Prepare your existing installation
  ---------------------------------------------
  i.   If you use login by email address, you must change the login method to
       login by username in the administration panel.  You will be required to
       login using your administation username.

  ii. Before unpacking any files:
      - Delete entire system/ folder.
      - Delete includes/.
      - Delete pnTemp/.

  iii. Upload all files from the package you downloaded, copying over your files.
       Manually edit the NEW config/config.php with your database credentials. Please
       be aware the config.php is quite different so please make sure you merge in
       the differences from the old config.php to the new one. To make this easy
       pay close attention to lines
            line 26: $ZConfig['System']['installed']
            line 28: $ZConfig['System']['prefix']
            line 46: $ZConfig['DBInfo']['default']['dsn']

       Do not change the following lines.
            line $ZConfig['System']['temp']

  2.3 Run the upgrade
  -------------------
  Run the upgrade script upgrade.php and follow the steps as described. There is
  no real interaction needed other than clicking on 'next'. All database changes
  that are necessary will be done automatically. At the end you will be redirected
  to your admin panel.

  2.4 Clean up and additional configuration
  -----------------------------------------
  After a successful upgrade you can remove the install folder and the files
  install.php and upgrade.php from the root folder of your site.
  If you use your own themes, please note that themes now require specific header
  information which you must update to use the lang, langdirection and charset
  plugin tags. Please refer to both andreas08's master.tpl template.
  If you disabled your site before starting the upgrade (see 2.2) you should
  re-enable it now.

  2.5 Post upgrade notes
  ----------------------
  If you use the Menutree module please note the following:
  The Menutree functionality has been ported into the Zikula Core, but this is not
  to be considered the same as the Menutree module because implementation in the
  Zikula Core is substantially different so the upgrade process will not 'import'
  the configurations from your Menutree module: they should be recreated manually.


3. Caution
==========
It should be noted that Zikula does not support any modification of the core code
or data structure. Zikula has been designed to be flexible enough to avoid any
need to modify the core, but if you find something missing that you believe could
be of widespread use, please submit a feature request to the feature request tracker
at http://code.zikula.org/core


4. Final Note
=============
Congratulations! Your upgrade is complete. We hope you enjoy using this new
Zikula version. If you have any comments, please use the feedback forum on
http://community.zikula.org.
