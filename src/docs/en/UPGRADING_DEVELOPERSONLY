- Change all module templates plugin delimiters to { and }.  For any template
  plugins inside a <script></script> block or a <style></style> block please
  use {{  and }}.  Please note the old delimiters will be supported until
  Zikula 1.5.0.

- All plugins with pn have been renamed without the pn prefix.  The pndebug
  plugin has been renamed to zdebug. Please adjust your templates accordingly.

- Change all instance is $pnRender = & pnRender::getInstance() to
  $renderer = Renderer::getInstance().

- All use of pnML is now deprecated.  Upgrade themes and modules.

- Rename all PNObject* to DBObject*.

- The use of DBUtil::executeSQL to return an ADODB object is now deprecated.
  DBUtil::executeSQL no longer returns an ADODB object but a Doctrine PDO object.
  Please use use of DBUtil::marshallObjects() after any manual SELECT through
  DBUtil::execute().

- The format of config.php has changed, please manually complete the values in
  the supplied config.php - note that base64 encoding is not supposed any more
  and everything must be in plain text (this is because base64 encoding is not
  actually an encryption).

- Theme module APIs theme_userapi_clear_compiled(), theme_userapi_clear_cache(),
  and pnrender_userapi_clear_compiled(), pnrender_userapi_clear_cache() are
  deprecated.  Please use Renderer->clear_compiled(), Renderer->clear_cache() and
  Theme->clear_compiled(), Theme->clear_cache().

- If you are using PHP 5.3.0 or greater please make sure the php.ini file has
  date.timezone set to a valid timezone like UTC, GMT+5, Europe/Berlin.

- Now you can add a requirement check for your blocks which will display a
  message if it's necessary into the admin panel. eg: the language block will be
  visible only if the multilanguage system is enabled, so for this block a
  requirement message was aded to inform the admin that this block will not be
  visible until he enables the multilanguage system.
