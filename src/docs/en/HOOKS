ZIKULA HOOKS
============
This document describes the Zikula Hook system.

What is a hook?
---------------
A hook is just another kind of event that occurs in Zikula and should really be called
'hookable events'.  Unlike events, hookable events are used to attach modules/plugins to
other modules so that they can UI functionality.  For example, a comments module could
attach comments to a blog module.  Similarly a ratings module could be attached to a
blog module, so that all articles would have now have ratings.

Other examples could be adding extra fields to forms to gather extra information.

Providers and Subscriber
------------------------
In this document we will use hook providers, and hook subscribers.  A provider is simply
a module/plugin that actually provides some functionality that can be attached to other
modules's output.

A subscriber is simply a module that understand hooks.  It can process hooks that are
provided by other modules.
