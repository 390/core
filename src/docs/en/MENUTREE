PURPOSE
-----------------
Module "menutree" has no functionalities - serves only as the "container" for the block. Bellowed description concerns only the block functionality.

MENUTREE BLOCK
-----------------
Menutree block allows to create multilevel, hierarchical menu. You can manage this block by "drag&drop" method.

USAGE
-----------------
To add a block follow the standard procedure: in administration panel choose Block -> New block -> menutree/Treelike menu (menutree).
Until first element in menu is created one have possibility to import one of existing menus ("menu", "extmenu" and "menutree"). If in menu, which will be imported, option "Display modules" was marked - links to all modules will be also imported.
Managing this block is possible by "drag&drop" method.
"Menutree" block allows to use well-know shorthands for modules link: [Module] or {Module}.

Menu generated by this block is unordered list (build by "ul" and "li" tags), obviously respecting structure build during block edition. 
Package contains also two example templates:
    "menutree/blocks_block_menutreeext.htm", which shows how to format vertical dropdown menu.
    "menutree/blocks_block_vertical.htm" - expample of vertical dropdown menu,
    "menutree/blocks_block_tree.htm" - expample of "tree-like" menu (similar to that in the admin panel, with the possibility for expanding and collapsing), this template uses javascript.

PERMISSIONS
-----------------
Permissions schema used by block "menutree" is the same as standard (core) menu: one can define permissions for all block (giving the block title) or only for single element (giving the link name). Permissions define for element are inherited by its subelements.

The permission schema is as follows
    Component: menutree:menutreeblock:
    Instance:  Block title:Link name:

The following are the relevant permissions you can set and what they do
NONE        block or element wont be displayed
READ        block or element will be displayed

Example:

Group          Component                  Instance                 Permission:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unregistered   menutree:menutreeblock:    Menu::                   NONE
All groups     menutree:menutreeblock:    Menu:Administration:     NONE

First rule will hide block titled "Menu" from unregistered users.
Second rule will hide element "Administration" (and all of it subelements - if there are subelements) from all groups.
